# Predicting Students' Dropout and Academic Success

This project aims to predict student dropout rates and academic success using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success).

## Project Outline

1. **Download and Load the Data:**
   - Download the dataset and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Explore and Preprocess the Data:**
   - Understand the features and target variable.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features.

3. **Split the Data:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Build Classification Models:**
   - Train multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
   - Evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

   - Create Pipeline: Create a pipeline that includes data scaling and the Random Forest classifier.
   - Train the Model: Fit the pipeline to the training data.
   -  Evaluate the Model: Predict on training and testing data, calculate accuracy, and print the classification report and confusion matrix.

5. **Feature Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Perform feature selection to identify important features.
   - Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search.

6. **Evaluate and Compare Models using ensample learning:**
   - Compare the models based on their performance metrics.
   - Choose the best-performing model.

7. **Model Interpretation and Insights:**
   - Interpret the model to understand which features are most influential.
   - Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings.
